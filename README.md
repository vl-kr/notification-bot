This is a script that I've used to check for an available vaccination appointment. <br>
After specifying the ID of the vaccination center, the script periodically retrieves a list of dates and numbers of available spots from the registration system of the National Health Information Centre of Slovak Republic.
<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: the registration system is not available anymore.
<br>
<br>
After a free spot is found, it notifies the user by sending an email (see below) and calling a specified number using Twilio.
